## Description
This is my first project using React! With this site, you can learn about who I am, my skills, projects, and even contact me!
For this site, I used `React Browser Router` to control the url endpoints and React Hooks like `UseEffect` and `UseState` for added functionality.

## Installation
To install on your own machine, simply clone down my repo, run `npm install` at the root directory, then run `npm start` in order to start the client server!
